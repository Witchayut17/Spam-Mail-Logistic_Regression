This project presented a machine learning–based spam email detection system using classical Natural Language Processing techniques.<br>
The system applies TF-IDF for text feature extraction and Logistic Regression for binary classification.<br>
By addressing class imbalance through weighted adjustment, the proposed approach achieves effective spam detection performance while maintaining computational efficiency.
